### About

Eliza is an artist, workshop facilitator, educator, astrologer, intuitive guide and life-long student of consciousness.

Born during the collapse of the Soviet Union and raised in Ecuador, she has always had to have a wide perspective on life, culture and belonging. She moved to the UK as a teenager. A life-long seeker and student of consciousness, Eliza holds a degree in Philosophy and an MA in Education. She taught Literature for 10 years, as well as Art to children; she holds regular art, art therapy and astrology workshops.

She is a self-taught artist - her artworks come from her studies, dreams and the
subconscious. She had her first group exhibition in April 2022 and her first solo exhibition in
July 2022 at Open House Hackney.

Elizaâ€™s work is a journey of exploration, integration and story-telling through symbols.
Through this journey she found astrology which quickly became her full-time offering,
alongside with continuing facilitating art workshops, teaching and sharing intuitive guidance.

Eliza is fluent in English and Spanish.
